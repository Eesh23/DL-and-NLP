This repo is centered around conducting an empirical study on text classification. The primary goal is to perform a classification empirical study on textual data using deep learning approaches and document the process to ensure reproducibility. This involves reviewing Python skills, exploring and utilizing Python machine learning packages like scikit-learn, engaging with Kaggle for datasets, implementing an MLP classifier, and experimenting with basic NLP tasks using spaCy.

Key activities include:
- Selecting a text classification dataset from provided options, with reduced versions available for practicality.
- Applying tasks from the NLP pipeline on the textual data to create derived datasets for further experimentation.
- Conducting a classification empirical study that involves encoding text as input features, defining models with default parameters (including Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron models), training/testing/evaluating these models across different datasets, and modifying MLP model parameters for comparative analysis.
- Documenting the entire empirical study in a Jupyter Notebook to detail the process followed, including dataset derivation, steps of the empirical study, and result analysis.
